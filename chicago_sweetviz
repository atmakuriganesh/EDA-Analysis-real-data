### Dataset Characteristics
- The City of Chicago salary dataset comprises 1,660 positions with 61 duplicates, containing 8 distinct features categorized as categorical (3), numerical (3), and text fields (2).
- The dataset is relatively compact at 514.4 KB RAM, suggesting it represents a subset of all city positions rather than the complete workforce.
  
### Salary Distribution
- The average salary among all positions is $53,000, with a median of $64,000. 
- This discrepancy between mean and median is largely due to the significant number of zero-value salaries in the dataset.
- Specifically, 34% of positions (560) have $0 recorded as their salary, which substantially skews the average downward.
- For positions with recorded salaries, the distribution ranges from a minimum of $31,000 to a maximum of $155,000, with the 95th percentile at $124,000.
- The salary distribution shows minimal skew (0.018) but has negative kurtosis (-1.17), indicating a flatter, more uniform distribution than normal across the salary bands.
- This suggests a relatively balanced compensation structure with fewer extreme outliers than typically found in large organizations.
  
### Position Classification
- The position classification system appears extremely detailed, with 1,595 distinct title codes (96%) and 1,539 unique job titles (93%) among 1,660 positions.
- This indicates an exceptionally granular job classification system with almost every position having a unique identifier.
- Most common positions include "Airport Operations Supervisor II," "First Deputy Director," "Assistant to the Commissioner," and "Contracts Administrator."

  
### Organizational Structure
The organizational structure is defined through several classification systems:

- Schedule (sch): 28 distinct schedules are identified, though 31% of positions are missing this designation
- Grade (grd): 47 distinct grades with 100% assignment rate
- Symbol (sym): Only 6% of positions have symbols assigned, with 4 distinct symbols used
- The presence of multiple classification dimensions with varying degrees of completion suggests a complex organizational structure that may have evolved over time with different classification approaches.
