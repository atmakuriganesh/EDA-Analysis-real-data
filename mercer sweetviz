Dataset Overview

Size: 8,713 rows with no duplicates, consuming 4.3 MB RAM
Features: 13 total features (1 categorical, 8 numerical, 4 text)
Data Completeness: Most features have good coverage, but specialization is missing for 26% of entries

Base Annual Compensation (baseannual_mean_ow)

Distribution: Right-skewed with a mean of $87k and median of $88k
Range: $0 - $269k with an IQR of $69,036
Notable: 18% of entries (1,551) are zero values, suggesting either missing data or positions without base salary
Dispersion: Standard deviation of $54,172 indicating substantial variation in compensation

Compensation Distribution Patterns

Bimodal Tendency: The histogram for base annual mean shows a slight bimodal distribution, with peaks around $50k-$60k and $100k-$120k, suggesting potential stratification between junior/mid-level roles and senior positions.
Compensation Spread: The interquartile range (IQR) increases progressively from base to total compensation (from $69k to $76k at the 75th percentile), indicating greater variability in bonus and incentive structures at higher levels.
Zero Values Impact: The 18% zero values significantly impact the overall distribution metrics and should be analyzed separately to understand if they represent missing data or actual zero-compensation roles.

Statistical Relationships

Low Skewness: Despite appearing right-skewed visually, the data has surprisingly low skewness values (-0.026 for base annual mean), suggesting a more balanced distribution than typical for compensation data.
Departmental Compensation Patterns: Engineering & Science has the highest headcount but not the highest compensation, while smaller departments like Project/Program Management and Data Analytics command premium salaries (exceeding $100k).
Kurtosis Indicators: All compensation metrics show slightly negative kurtosis (around -0.4 to -0.6), indicating a flatter distribution than normal with fewer extreme outliers than might be expected.

Organizational Structure Insights

Position to Employee Ratio: With 8,495 unique position titles for 8,713 employees, there's an almost 1:1 ratio, suggesting extremely specialized job definitions or potential data inconsistency issues.
Classification Complexity: The hierarchical coding system (e.g., SCN.03.R02.S30) appears to follow a consistent pattern that could reveal hidden organizational design principles beyond the explicit family/subfamily structure.
Missing Specialization Pattern: The 26% missing specialization data isn't randomly distributed and likely correlates with specific departments or position types, potentially indicating areas where standardized classification is more challenging.


Key Insights

The data shows considerable compensation variation across different organizational families
There's a substantial premium for total cash compared to base salary (approximately 10-15%)
The dataset has comprehensive position coding (mjlcode) with a standardized hierarchical structure
Engineering & Science, IT, and Sales/Marketing positions form the largest employee segments
The distribution of specializations shows significant granularity with most specializations representing less than 1% of the workforce
