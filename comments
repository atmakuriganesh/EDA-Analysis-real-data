# Count columns with and without outliers in both dataframes and compare
# Summarizes findings to show what percentage of numerical columns contain outliers
# Both datasets exhibit outliers in over 85% of their numerical columns, indicating significant data variability

# Finding outliers in quartile statistics (Q1/Q3) is unconventional as they're already summary metrics
# Consider analyzing pattern deviations in quartile values rather than treating them as traditional outliers
