# Count columns with and without outliers in both dataframes and compare
# Summarizes findings to show what percentage of numerical columns contain outliers
# Both datasets exhibit outliers in over 85% of their numerical columns, indicating significant data variability

# Finding outliers in quartile statistics (Q1/Q3) is unconventional as they're already summary metrics
# Consider analyzing pattern deviations in quartile values rather than treating them as traditional outliers

# The visualization (boxplot) shows salary distribution by family/department with good variation - some departments have higher median salaries and wider ranges than others 
The extremely high chi-square statistics (200399.00 for Family vs PositionTitle and Family vs Sub-Family; 1054273.00 for PositionTitle vs Sub-Family) suggest not just statistical significance but extremely strong associations between these organizational variables.
