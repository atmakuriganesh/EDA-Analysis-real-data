Overview
The Cook County salary dataset contains information on 2,966 government positions, providing a comprehensive view of the county's workforce compensation structure. 
The data shows considerable complexity in job classifications, salary ranges, and organizational structure that impact compensation management and budget planning.

Salary Distribution
The average salary across all positions is $59,000, with a median of $63,000, indicating a slight negative skew in the midrange of the distribution.
The full salary range spans from $0 to $288,000, representing an extraordinarily wide compensation spectrum typical of large government organizations with diverse professional requirements.
Notably, 24% of positions (725) show $0 as the average salary, which requires further investigation. These could represent vacant positions, unpaid roles, or simply missing data that should be addressed for accurate workforce analysis.
For positions with recorded salary ranges, the minimum rates average $78,000 with median of $69,000, while maximum rates average $143,000 with median of $112,000. This creates an average salary range width of $64,000, though the median range width is much narrower at $35,000. This disparity indicates that while most positions have modest salary ranges, some have exceptionally wide bands that significantly impact the average.

Organizational Structure
The job classification system appears highly granular, with 2,562 distinct job descriptions (86% unique) among 2,966 positions.
Administrative positions are particularly common, with various levels of Administrative Assistants representing the most frequently occurring roles. This suggests a substantial administrative support infrastructure within the county government.
The grading system shows similar complexity, with 104 distinct grade ladders and 422 different grade combinations. The most common grade ladder designation is "NONE-2" (38% of positions), while 23% have blank grade designations. This fragmentation in the grade structure could present challenges for career progression planning and compensation management.
Union representation appears in several categories, including SEIU 73 (3%) and AFSCME (approximately 4% combined), indicating a mixed union and non-union environment that adds complexity to compensation administration.
  
Key Insights
The extreme granularity in job classifications (86% unique) suggests potential inefficiencies in position management and possible opportunities for rationalization.
Similarly, the presence of 172 distinct salary ranges for 2,966 positions indicates a highly complex compensation structure that may be challenging to administer consistently.
The significant gap between the 95th percentile salary ($121,000) and the maximum salary ($288,000) reveals exceptional compensation for a small number of senior positions, which is typical in government structures with appointed or executive leadership roles.
